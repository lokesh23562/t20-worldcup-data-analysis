Feedback and Questions

For feedback or questions about the project, please reach out by opening an issue on GitHub or contact me at:

Do you want me to expand the "Visualizations" section with individual explanations for each graph (1_Distribution of Runs Scored, 2_Distribution of Batting Average, etc.) so that each chart you generated gets documented in README? That would make it fully ready for GitHub.
